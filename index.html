                    <p>
                        I'm currently a university student studying the degree called "Bachelor of Information Technology" at Griffith University majoring in Cyber Security. It started with the first Coding Projects in Python book by DK to spark my goals. The book had captured my interest by using pythons built in module tkinter to build amazing graphics based games. I'm fascinated with problem solving and enjoy delivering results for the most complex solutions. The continuous learning aspect of IT is captivating and in my spare time I apply the learnt knowledge for personal projects by utilising new frameworks and technologies.  With aspirations and ambitions to become a professional Web developer or an System administrator, taking small and gradual steps towards my goal will lead me into the correct pathway. <br><br>

                        Craving to gain more understanding about any task. This is evident in my hobbies such as playing different instruments; guitar and piano. Having discipline to gain a deep understanding of both instruments that will be apply to any task.
                        I'm trustworthy and eager to learn a range of tasks. I'm a self motivated individual whilst being patient and willinging to learn any challenging problems. With the mindset to continuously need for challenging problems, I'm motivated to constantly learn and adapt to new activities.
